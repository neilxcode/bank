# Bank App
This is the start of a very simple app, which was created in order to emulate the UI of a banking app. 

## Development Environment
Visual Studio Code was used entirely for the development of this app, using C# of course.

## Testing
This app is run entirely on the console, the loops in this code will return an error message if the wrong data type is entered for any of the input requests.

## Credits
This app was made during the guidance of Harvard CS50X specialization course.
